# mg5_aMC_tutorial

The repository contains material for the [MadGraph 5 aMC@NLO](https://launchpad.net/mg5amcnlo) (MG5_aMC) tutorial at the [1st Workshop on New Light Physics and Photon-beam Experiments](https://indico.jlab.org/event/413/). Besides the tutorial PDF, it includes:

1. [DarkPhoton_UFO](./DarkPhoton_UFO) is a Universal FeynRules Output model where a dark photon couples to electrons, muons, or taus.

2. [analysis_LHE_output.ipynb](./analysis_LHE_output.ipynb) is a Jupyter notebook that converts \*.lhe files to \*.npy files. It also contains an example to use python to anlysize events for e+ e- → γ A', A' → e+ e- process at the [BaBar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BaBar_experiment). 

3. [LHEtoPython](./LHEtoPython) is a script used to convert LHE output from MG5_aMC (please give it permission). 

4. [unweighted_events.lhe.gz](./unweighted_events.lhe.gz) is an MG5_aMC output example for e+ e- → γ A', A' → e+ e- at the BaBar.

For any questions on the model or the notebook, please contact Yiming Zhong (ymzhong@kicp.uchicago.edu).
